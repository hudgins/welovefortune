We Love Fortune for PICO-8
--------------------------

This is an homage to the Commodore 64 Wheel of Fortune game from the mid-80's.
It is built for the PICO-8 fantasy console.

Note that the code is less-than-entirely clean due to much sacrifice in the name
of saving "tokens". To best emulate the 8-bit development experience, PICO-8 has
[arbitrary limitations](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#Code_Limits).
